# trueTools

All trueTool stacks (which were all one-carders)
(magnified by a factor of two)
in alphabetical order,
hence my favorite stack "vue" at the end.

Note that visual appearance was already somewhat broken when
I took those screenshots in 2024,
because Apple had made changes to their fonts
and due to restrictions of the emulator.

## JPEGtoPICT

This stack allowed to convert JPEG images (and I think also GIFs)
to the PICT format that was used widely on Macs at the time,
using Apple's Quicktime via AppleScript.

See also its [readme](../READMEs/trueTools-JPEGtoPICT.pdf).

## spider

This stack turned HyperCard stack cards into webpages
with one image screenshot stack card.

See also its [readme](../READMEs/trueTools-spider.pdf).

## Text to HTML

This stack simply converted given text to HTML,
i.e. it replaced some characters by their HTML escapes
(like "&amp;" for "&") plus detected bold and italic text.

## trueConvert

This stack converted stacks colorized with trueColor
to ones colorized with Apple's Color Tools (AddColor XCMD),
at the time still hoping for a HyperCard 3.0 sometime
with native color support
which would have likely only supported color
added  via Apple's Color Tools.

## truePrint

This stack took screenshots of cards of HyperCard stacks
to the clipboard and also allowed to print them.

See also its [readme](../READMEs/trueTools-truePrint.pdf).

## vue

This is my favorite stack in the "trueTools" collection.
It allowed to view images full screen without distractions,
with possibility to zoom in and out, and to move around.
